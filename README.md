# omega-genius-test

## Description
This application is a small quiz for testing knowledge on concepts from javascript.  I built this application because I wanted to test my own knowledge on javascript while also learning a real world application for the concepts learned.  This quiz allows anybody who administers it to verify that their perspective coder has base level javascript knowledge.  I learned so much about how if/else statements can be used, and how to write successful functions in js.
